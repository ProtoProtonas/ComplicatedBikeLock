version 1.65.3
   It is now possible to write and read (multiple) data blocks on a classic card from the command line. 
   All options are in capitals. Enable to write and read a message to the card from the command line. 
   If the message does not fit within a single 16 bytes block, the next data address block 
   (which might be in a next sector) will be used. 
   In principle one could read or write 16 sector * 3 (blocks) * 16 bytes.
   code clean-up for quality
