## About the project
This project is a part of Real Time Embedded Programming 5 course at the University of Glasgow. 
In this project we will attempt to make a smart bike lock which uses face recognition, an RFID scanner and a keypad code to protect the bike and keep it locked.

## Prerequisites
OpenCV. Version used for development is 4.5.1.
Installing it is not an easy and straightforward process. We highly recommend following this guide: https://qengineering.eu/install-opencv-4.5-on-raspberry-pi-4.html
