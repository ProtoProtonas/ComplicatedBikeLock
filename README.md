## About the project
This project is done as a part of the Real Time Embedded Programming course in the University of Glasgow.
We will attempt to make a smart bike lock with face recognition, RFID authenticator and a keypad.
The whole system will be running locally on a RaspberryPi.

## Prerequisites
Anyone compiling the project should have OpenCV installed on their machine. The version used for this project is 4.5.1.
It is not an easy and straightforward process to install OpenCV so following this tutorial is recommended: https://qengineering.eu/install-opencv-4.5-on-raspberry-pi-4.html

## Hardware used

<ul>
  <li>Raspberry Pi 3B and 4B (tested on both)</li>
  <li>Raspberry Pi Camera V2</li>
  <li>RC522 RFID module</li>
  <li>Computer keyboard</li>
</ul>
